2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the DApp.

3. Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the DApp.

4. Browse ongoing auctions, place bids, and monitor your auction activity.

## Smart Contracts

The smart contracts in this project facilitate the auction process. They handle bids, auction creation, and winner determination. These contracts are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

- `AuctionFactory.sol`: Responsible for creating new auctions.
- `Auction.sol`: Manages bidding and winner determination for individual auctions.

## Testing

Smart contract tests are located in the `test` folder. These tests ensure the correct functioning of the smart contract. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Run the following command to execute the tests:

```bash
truffle test
```

This command will initiate the smart contract tests and display the results in the terminal.
